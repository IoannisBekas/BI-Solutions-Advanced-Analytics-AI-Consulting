I have a two-column layout that is NOT working correctly.
Please REBUILD the page from scratch using HTML, CSS (or SCSS), and vanilla JavaScript with the following very strict requirements:

1. Layout
   - Left column: vertical navigation with 4–6 items (e.g. "Introduction", "Experience", "Projects", "Education").
   - Right column: long scrollable content with sections for each nav item.
   - The left column must use `position: sticky; top: 100px;` (or similar) so it stays in view while the right column scrolls.
   - The page must NOT have layout jumps or overlapping elements while scrolling.

2. Scroll-sync (Scrollspy)
   - Each section in the right column must have a unique `id` (e.g. `#intro`, `#experience`, etc.).
   - Each nav item on the left must be an `<a href="#section-id">`.
   - Implement Scrollspy using `IntersectionObserver` (do not use a framework):
       - Observe every section element.
       - When a section is at least 50% visible, add an `.active` class to the matching nav link and remove `.active` from all others.
       - The `.active` class must change style (e.g. bold text + left border) so it is clearly visible.
   - The active state must update smoothly and accurately while scrolling up and down; it must never be “stuck” on the wrong item.

3. Sticky behavior details
   - The sticky left nav must:
       - Stay aligned with the scroll position.
       - Not move outside the viewport when the user scrolls the right content.
       - Respect the header height if there is a top header (use proper top offset or padding).
   - Test with long content so I can scroll several screens and confirm the nav stays in sync.

4. Image / picture quality
   - At the top of the right column include a profile image (e.g. a headshot placeholder).
   - The image container must have a fixed aspect ratio (e.g. 16:9 or square).
   - Use CSS to ensure the image:
       - Does NOT stretch or distort.
       - Is centered and cropped nicely.
       - Use: `img { width: 100%; height: 100%; object-fit: cover; object-position: center; }`
   - The image must scale responsively on smaller screens while preserving aspect ratio.

5. Responsiveness
   - Desktop: two-column layout (left nav ~25–30%, right content ~70–75%).
   - Tablet: columns can stack or shrink but the sticky behavior must still work.
   - Mobile: the left nav becomes a horizontal bar at the top or collapsible menu; Scrollspy must still correctly highlight the active section.

6. Animations (optional but desirable)
   - Use simple fade-in or slide-in animations on sections when they appear, either with CSS transitions or a lightweight library like AOS.
   - Animations must NOT interfere with Scrollspy or sticky behavior.

7. Code expectations
   - Provide complete `index.html`, `styles.css` (or `.scss`), and `script.js`.
   - In `script.js` implement and clearly comment:
       - The IntersectionObserver setup.
       - The logic that maps `section.id` to nav links.
   - The final result must have:
       - Correct sticky nav behavior.
       - Accurate scroll-synced active state.
       - A clean, properly cropped profile image.

Goal:
Deliver a polished, bug-free page where:
- the left navigation stays sticky,
- the active item always matches the visible section while scrolling,
- and the profile image looks clean, centered, and not distorted at any viewport size.
