Create a new dedicated “About the Founder” page at route:
/about

This page must include:
• A sticky left-hand vertical navigation menu
• Scroll-linked content sections on the right
• Automatic highlighting of the active section as the user scrolls
• Smooth animations and a modern clean layout

STRUCTURE:

Use a two-column layout:
Left Column (Sidebar):
    - Fixed/sticky navigation menu that remains visible while scrolling.
    - Menu items linking to each section of the founder biography:
          1. Introduction
          2. United Nations Experience
          3. BI Solutions (Consulting)
          4. IAEA Experience
          5. Cultural Diplomacy Institute
          6. Photo & Contact
    - As the user scrolls through the content on the right, highlight the active menu item.
    - Implement scroll detection using IntersectionObserver (preferred) or a scroll library.

Right Column (Main Content):
    - Each section must be a separate scrollable block.
    - Apply fade-in or slide-in animations (AOS or custom IntersectionObserver).
    - On desktop: two-column layout.
    - On mobile: sidebar collapses into a top horizontal menu or a dropdown.

CONTENT SECTIONS (use the following text):

SECTION 1 — Introduction
    Add the founder’s portrait photo (placeholder for now).
    Add a short introduction summarizing expertise:
    “A data science and analytics specialist with experience across the United Nations, international agencies, and global enterprises. Expertise includes strategic analytics, machine learning, decision intelligence, CRM optimization, and data product development.”

SECTION 2 — United Nations Experience (Senior Data Scientist, 2023–2025)
    Include the full bullet list from the founder’s UN experience.

SECTION 3 — BI Solutions (Founder & Principal Consultant, 2021–2023)
    Include the full bullet list from the founder’s consulting experience.

SECTION 4 — IAEA (Information Systems Analyst, 2020–2021)
    Include the full bullet list from the IAEA role.

SECTION 5 — Hellenic Institute of Cultural Diplomacy (2019–2020)
    Include the bullet list for this role.

SECTION 6 — Photo & Contact
    - Display the founder photo again (styled).
    - Add LinkedIn + Email icons.
    - Add a “Book a Consultation” button (placeholder link).

INTERACTIONS & BEHAVIOR:

1. Sticky Sidebar:
   - Use CSS position: sticky; top: 0.
   - Sidebar stays fixed while the right content scrolls.

2. Scroll-Linked Highlight:
   - Detect which section is currently visible using IntersectionObserver.
   - Automatically apply an "active" class to the corresponding sidebar menu item.
   - Smooth scroll to sections when clicking sidebar links.

3. Animations:
   - Fade-in, slide-in, or staggered animations for text and images.
   - Smooth transitions consistent with the site’s design.

4. Visual Design:
   - Follow the site’s color palette, typography, spacing, and card styles.
   - Soft shadows, rounded corners, and a clean minimal layout.
   - Fully responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile.

GOAL:
Deliver a premium “About the Founder” page with a sticky left sidebar and scroll-linked navigation. The active menu item highlights as the user scrolls, and each biography section animates into view. Include the full professional biography and photo in a visually polished, modern layout.
