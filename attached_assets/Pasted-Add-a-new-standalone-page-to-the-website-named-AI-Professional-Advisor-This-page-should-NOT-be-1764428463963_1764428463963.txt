Add a new standalone page to the website named “AI Professional Advisor”.

This page should NOT be part of the public homepage or services pages. It should exist as its own route:
   /ai-advisor

Page Requirements:
1. Display the existing AI advisor UI:
   - The three professional role buttons (“Λογιστής”, “Δικηγόρος”, “Σύμβουλος”)
   - The question input field
   - The send/submit button
   - The header and description text as shown in the design

2. The page must be publicly visible. Anyone can open it and see the interface.

3. Add subscription gating logic:
   - When a user presses the “send”/submit button:
        • If the user is NOT an active subscriber:
              Show a modal or popup message:
              “This feature is available only to active customers with an active subscription.”
              Do not send the request to the AI endpoint.
        • If the user IS an active subscriber:
              Allow the request to be sent normally to the Gemini API handler.

4. Create a simple mock check for user subscription status.
   - You may implement this as:
        • a placeholder boolean variable (e.g., `isSubscriber = false`)
        • or a function returning mocked subscription state
   - This logic must be easy to replace later when real authentication is added.

5. Style Requirements:
   - Match the existing UI: modern, minimal, rounded corners, soft shadows, and center alignment.
   - The UI should be responsive for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
   - Modal/popup must have a modern, smooth fade-in animation.

6. Behavior:
   - When a non-subscriber clicks “send”, do NOT clear the input field.
   - When a subscriber clicks “send”, perform a normal API call.
   - Disable the send button while the API is processing (loading state).

Goal:
Create a gated version of the AI Professional Advisor feature on a dedicated page. 
The page is visible to everyone, but interactive response functionality is restricted 
to users with an active subscription.
