Create a complete multi-page website using HTML, CSS (or SCSS), and vanilla JavaScript. 
The site must be fully responsive, lightweight, and similar in motion/visual style to cactusweb.gr.

Requirements:

1. Animations & Motion
   - Use a lightweight scroll-animation library (AOS.js or equivalent) or custom IntersectionObserver logic.
   - Apply fade-in, slide-in, and staggered reveal animations to sections, images, cards, and text blocks.
   - Add smooth scrolling for internal navigation.
   - Add hover animations for cards, images, and buttons (scale, opacity shift, or shadow).
   - Include animated transitions for hero text and call-to-action buttons.

2. Scroll-Based Effects
   - Trigger animations once when elements enter the viewport.
   - Implement parallax-style motion for hero sections or background images.
   - Add a shrinking and fixed header that transforms when the user scrolls down.

3. Site Structure
   - Create the following pages: Home, Services, Portfolio, Blog, Contact.
   - Include a responsive navigation bar with dropdowns for nested service categories.
   - Home page must include:
       • Hero section with animated headline and description.
       • Services grid with animated cards.
   - Portfolio page: grid with hover effects and sample items.
   - Blog page: list at least 3 example posts with title, date, excerpt, and “Read more”.
   - Contact page: simple form and contact details.

4. Responsiveness
   - Ensure optimal layout for desktop, tablet, and mobile.
   - Implement an animated mobile menu (slide-in / slide-out).

5. Style
   - Use a clean, modern, minimal design emphasizing whitespace.
   - Define a consistent color palette and typography hierarchy.
   - Maintain a professional aesthetic similar to cactusweb.gr but not an imitation.

6. Interactive AI Component
   - Add three selector buttons labeled:
       • "Λογιστής"
       • "Δικηγόρος"
       • "Σύμβουλος Επιχειρήσεων"
   - When a user selects one of these roles, highlight the active selection.
   - Below the buttons, include a text box where the user writes a question.
   - Add a “Submit” button.
   - On submit:
       • Send the selected role + the user’s question to a Gemini API endpoint.
       • The AI must answer using Greek law and real data relevant to the chosen role.
       • Display the result in a formatted response container under the form.

7. Optional Enhancements
   - Add light/dark mode toggle.
   - Include a small JavaScript utility for custom parallax or subtle motion effects without heavy frameworks.

Goal:
Deliver a complete website with layout, animations, motion behavior, and interaction quality inspired by cactusweb.gr, including a functional AI-powered Q&A component driven by Gemini and focused on Greek law and professional roles.
