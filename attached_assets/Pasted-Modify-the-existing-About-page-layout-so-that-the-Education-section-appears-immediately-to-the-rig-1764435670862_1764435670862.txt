Modify the existing About page layout so that the “Education” section appears immediately to the right of the profile picture, in a 2-column block at the top of the content.

Requirements:

1. Profile Header Layout
   - Create a top content block under the page title “Ioannis Bekas” that contains:
       LEFT SIDE: the profile image (fixed size, rounded corners)
       RIGHT SIDE: the “Education” section
   - Use a two-column layout (CSS grid or flexbox) only for this header area.
   - The Education subsection should include its heading and bullet-points or timeline items.
   - Ensure the image and Education block align vertically and maintain equal top padding.

2. Sticky Navigation
   - Keep the existing left sticky navigation exactly as it is.
   - The new Education block beside the image should NOT break the scroll-sync.
   - The Education section must still correspond to its item in the left navigation.
   - When the user scrolls past the image and Education block, the Education item should activate as usual.

3. Section Ordering
   - Keep the global section order:
       Introduction
       United Nations
       IAEA Experience
       Cultural Diplomacy
       Education
       Get in Touch
   - Only VISUALLY reposition Education next to the image, without changing its logical position in the page structure.
   - After the header block, the Education section should not appear again lower in the page.

4. Responsive Behavior
   - On desktop: image left, Education right.
   - On tablets: stack Education under the image with proper spacing.
   - On mobile: image first, education second (full-width).

5. Styling
   - Maintain existing typography, spacing, and animations.
   - Education block should match the style of other sections.
   - Do not distort or stretch the profile image.

6. Output Format
   - Return ONLY the updated HTML, CSS, and JS required for the new image-plus-education header.
   - Do NOT regenerate unrelated parts of the page.

Goal:
Place the Education section to the right of the profile picture in the header area, while preserving the sticky navigation, scroll-synced highlighting, responsive layout, and professional visual design.
